# Adlister

1. Project's Title : Adlister Group Progject for Codeup.

2. Project Description:

A CRUD project that simulates a e-commerce website, more specifically a game website that allows you to buy, sell, update, add, and delete video games.
We used Java, HTML/JSP/Servlets, CSS/Bootstrap, mysql, and Tomcat for this application because it gets the job done when creating an e-commerce website.
Some of the challenges we faced were many, like creating servlets and working with an existing framework and trying to work with it, but it functions and works.



3. How to Install and Run the Project:
just press the Green play button on the top right coner and you should be ready to use the e-commerce web application!



4. How to Use the Project:

Create a user for the website and you will be able to view, create, update, and delete the game card.
You will only be able to create, update, and delete items if you have an account, but will not be able to do this without an account!
However, a person without an account will be able to view the items (only view) nothing more.
